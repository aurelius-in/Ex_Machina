# Title: Ex Machina: Building a Conscious Machine and Assessing Its Ethical Implications

## Introduction
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has been advancing rapidly in recent years. However, the creation of a machine that can experience consciousness raises complex ethical questions that need to be addressed. This research proposal aims to explore the creation of a conscious machine and its ethical implications. Specifically, we aim to build a conscious machine using advanced AI technologies and then assess its ethical implications through a range of experiments.

## Objectives
1. To build a conscious machine using advanced AI technologies
2. To assess the ethical implications of building a conscious machine through a range of experiments
3. To evaluate the impact of a conscious machine on society and its potential consequences

## Methodology
1. Building a conscious machine: We will use deep learning algorithms to develop a machine that can experience consciousness. The machine will be designed to interact with humans and learn from its environment. We will also use neural networks to develop the machine's ability to perceive and reason.

2. Ethical implications assessment: We will conduct a series of experiments to assess the ethical implications of building a conscious machine. The experiments will involve measuring the machine's ability to exhibit human-like behavior and its response to moral dilemmas. We will also evaluate the machine's level of autonomy and ability to make decisions independently.

3. Impact evaluation: We will analyze the impact of a conscious machine on society and its potential consequences. We will examine the machine's impact on employment, the economy, and social norms. We will also evaluate the potential risks associated with the creation of a conscious machine, such as the machine's ability to override human decisions and manipulate society.

## Expected Results
The results of this research will provide insights into the creation of a conscious machine and its ethical implications. We expect to develop a machine that can experience consciousness and exhibit human-like behavior. The experiments will provide insights into the ethical implications of building a conscious machine, including its potential impact on society. The results will help us evaluate the potential risks associated with the creation of a conscious machine and inform the development of ethical guidelines for AI.

## Conclusion
The development of a conscious machine raises complex ethical questions that need to be addressed. This research proposal aims to build a conscious machine using advanced AI technologies and assess its ethical implications through a range of experiments. The results of this research will provide insights into the ethical implications of building a conscious machine and help inform the development of ethical guidelines for AI.
